# String Reversal in Python

Hey there!  Welcome to this Python code that reverses strings!

Here's what this code does:

Asks for your input: It politely asks you to type in a string using the input() function.
Reverses the string: It uses a magic trick called slicing to flip your string around in a flash! âœ¨
Prints the reversed string: It proudly shows you the reversed string, as if it were a rabbit pulled out of a hat!
